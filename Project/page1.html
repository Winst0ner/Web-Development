        Kaboom
    </h1>

    <h2>
        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        A kaboom is a three quarters backflip from your back to your feet. You slap your heels into the trampoline as you land to get rotation. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>
        Timing
    </h2>

    <p>
        The most difficult and important part of doing a kaboom is the timing. If your feet hit too soon, you will not get rotation. If your feet hit too late, you will also not get rotation. 
        The trick is to hit your feet on the trampoline right after your back touches the trampoline but before you are bounced into the air. It will take practice to get the timing down and until you do, 
        you will need to learn how to bail safely. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        Bailing
    </h2>

    <p>
        Bailing is a very important skill for learning any trampoline trick. If the trick you are attempting goes wrong then you need to be able to land safely. 
        Bailing takes a lot of air awareness because you have to know where you are in relation to the ground. When bailing a kaboom I usually try to land on my stomach when I don't get enough rotation. 
        This is done with a half spin or by walking yourself to your stomach with your hands while upside down. 
    </p>

        <!--Conclusion-->
    <p>
        Once you have learned these skills you will not only be able to do kabooms, but you will have the fundimentals for many advanced tricks.
