       Dub Back

    <h2>
        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        A dub back is a flip with two backwards rotations over your head.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>
        Progression
    </h2>

    <p>
        The dub back is a very scary trick for someone who has never done it before. It requires you to just send it but there are steps that you can do before that. Start with doing a backflip to your back.
        Make sure to keep you head forward as you land becuase if your head hits the tramp at that speed it can give you a nasty headache. Once you are very comfortable with the backflip to stomach, the next step is to send a dub back into a foam pit.
        This can be sketchy but even if you mess up, the foam is soft and its pretty hard to injure yourself in a foam pit. Do dub backs into a foam pit over and over until you have a feel for how much power and rotation you need to land on your feet. 
        Once you can spot the landing and land on you feet everytime, I would recomend trying to land it on an airbag. If you are comfortable doing it into an airbag or don't have access to one then it is time to take it to the trampoline. 
        Try having a friend throw a pad underneath you as you land or if you don't have any friends, just send it. Once you have gotten to this point you are ready it is just a matter of getting the courage to do it.

    <h2>
        Tucking
    </h2>

    <p>
        Tucking is a big part of flips especially double flips. It can help you rotate faster and protect you if you mess up. There are many diffrent ways to tuck but my favorite way is the cowboy tuck. 
        To do this you pull your knees as close to your shoulders as possible while also pulling them out to the sides. This will optimise rotation speed becuase the smaller and wider you are the faster you spin. 
        This particular tuck has another advantage over the regular way. If you mess up and don't open up out of your tuck, when you hit the ground, your legs will be pushed to the sides of your head instead of directly into your chin.
        I used to tuck my legs directly below me like I was about to cannonball but I changed when I landed a double frontflip while still tucked and kneed myself in the chin so hard I almost knocked myself out.
